An ePub Reader for your WordPress posts and pages. 

== Description ==

An ePub Reader for WordPress. This plugin provides a simple shortcode entry as well as a custom post type to give you control over how the epub is displayed.

The underlying code uses a fork of the framework provided by [Futurepress' epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js). 

=== Note ===

There are two ways this plugin can read an epub:

1. As an `.epub`. This is clearly the easiest way, just upload and link to the file directly. However, this is *not* the most efficient way for the user (because extra code is needed to download the whole epub in one go and the unzip it and *then* their browser can use it).
1. As an extracted `.epub`. Upload the epub as normal, but use an 'unzip' tool to extract the contents of the epub to files and folders on your server. This is the most efficient for the end user. (It also has the benefit of stopping 3rd parties easily downloading the whole book easily, if that's important to you). 


=== Short Code ===

Just drop in the shortcode into your blog posts or pages to embed an iFrame with fullscreen reader capabilities.

eg.

`[epub-reader src="some/path.epub" width="640" height="480"]`


=== Custom Post Type ===

In the admin area, you'll see 'ePub Reader Pages' which are pages that are designed to give a full-browser view of the epub. These pages are largely theme-indepdendant.

Yes. Although there may be some issues, the plugin is responsive in design and reflows accordingly.
